### Simple Stack Implementation Using Ruby

Implement Stack programming concept using ruby, include Push and Pop method implementation, maximum number stored on stack method implementation and mean value for numbers stored on stack, stack applying FILO methodology.

##### Notices:

- ruby files will exists under `application` folder.

- Stack implementation exists on `stack.rb` file for `Stack` class which include initial stack implementation(push, pop and maximum number methods).

- Extra Stack implementation exists on `extra.rb` file for `Extra` class which include extra methods(mean value method) for stack implementation.

- For Testing Both Classes, can use `main.rb` file.


##### Environment (Optional):

There installed environment for Ruby using Vagrant to run Examples, To install vagrant [See official Doc](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) you must install virtualBox first [See official Doc](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

###### To Run Example:
  - load vagrant box with next command
    ```
    cd /project-path && vagrant up
    ```

  - To access example code on vagrant box using SSH with next command
  ```
  cd /project-path && vagrant ssh
  cd /home/vagrant/application
  ```
